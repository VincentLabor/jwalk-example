        <h2 class="bot1EMPadding">Mission & Vision</h2>
        <h3>The JesusWalk Youth Conference is designed to open the eyes of our youth to the potential they have in
            Christ.</h3>
        <p>Our vision is that every student breaks from their worldly chains to become who God has designed them to
            be—each in their own way a disciple furthering His Kingdom. Our mission at the JesusWalk Youth Conference is
            to provide an open and safe refuge for youth to experience God and His Word. 1 John 2:6 says, “Whoever
            claims to live in him must live as Jesus did.”</p>
        <br>
        <p>We give our students a clear picture of how to move beyond the conference— influenced and driven by the
            Gospel to continually live in His example. What drives JesusWalk is the people who help make it happen.
            We’ve built this conference with our own youth & young adults to work together as one body and strive for
            one goal: transform the lives of our students. With the guidance of the CCMP (California Christian Mission
            to the Philippines), JesusWalk continues to grow and find new ways of reaching out.</p>

            <hr>
            <h3>AUTHENTIC CONNECTIONS</h3>
            <P>Building relationships with people from all different walks of life is one of the core values of
                JesusWalk.
                Authentic connections that are inspired by Christ, allow people to feel fully known and truly loved by
                God.
                The JesusWalk family celebrates the community we have built through fellowship, prayer, and a whole lot
                of
                fun!</P>

            <h3>HONORING OUR ROOTS</h3>
            <p>Recognizing where we have come from, inspires where we are going. At JesusWalk, one of our core values
                brings
                honor to our roots. Our background tells stories of ancestors, family members, friends, and even the
                unknown
                heroes who have paved the way for us. Their journeys are filled with challenges, achievements, and
                moments
                of pure faith. We are grateful for their stories of sacrifice and we honor what God did throughout their
                lives so that generations of people would come to know Him.</p>
                <hr>
            <h3>STUDENT LEADERSHIP</h3>
            <p>Serving and leading with compassion toward all people is one of the core values of JesusWalk. We aim to
                model
                our lives like Jesus Christ, by following His example of servant leadership. We choose to lead others to
                Christ by serving people and putting their needs first. We lead together as a community by supporting
                one
                another.</p>
                <hr>
            <h3>CONTINUOUS GROWTH</h3>
            <p>Discovering our potential in Christ inspires the limitless possibilities that are out there for the
                JesusWalk
                ministry. One of our core values at JesusWalk is the desire to grow spiritually and personally so we can
                further God's vision for His kingdom. We strengthen our potential by continuing to grow individually and
                learn together as a community.</p>

    <section class="whatWeBelieve top4EMPadding bot4EMPadding">
        <div class="width90">
            <h2 class="bot1EMPadding">WHAT WE BELIEVE</h3>
                <h3>GOD</h3>
                <P> We believe in one infinitely perfect, eternal and personal God, the transcendent Creator and
                    sovereign
                    Sustainer of the universe. This one God exists eternally and simultaneously as three distinct
                    persons:
                    Father, Son and Holy Spirit. All three persons in the Godhead share equally and completely in power,
                    nature and glory.</P>
                <h3>CHRIST</h3>
                <P>We believe Jesus Christ is both God and true man. We also believe in the great events leading up to
                    and
                    surrounding Christ’s life and ministry, including: His eternal preexistence, His virgin birth, His
                    attesting miracles, His sinless life, His sacrificial death on the cross, His bodily resurrection
                    from
                    the dead, His ascension into heaven, and His present work in heaven as High Priest and Advocate. He
                    will
                    return in glory to resurrect and judge all mankind.</P>
                <h3>HOLY SPIRIT</h3>
                <P>
                    We believe the Holy Spirit is a Divine Person, coequal with the Father and the Son. We also believe
                    in
                    the ministry of the Holy Spirit in salvation, glorifying Christ, convicting people of their sin,
                    bringing about the restoration of a right relationship with God, and indwelling believers and
                    empowering
                    them for godly living and spiritual service to God.</P>
                <h3>SCRIPTURE</h3>
                <P>We believe the Bible is the Word of God. As a “God-breathed” revelation, it is verbally inspired and
                    completely without error in its original writings. While God supernaturally directed the writing of
                    the
                    Bible, that writing reflects the words and literary styles of its individual human authors.
                    Scripture
                    reveals the being, nature and character of God and especially His will for the salvation of human
                    beings
                    through Jesus Christ. Therefore the Bible is the supreme and final authority in all matters that it
                    addresses.</P>
                <h3>REDEMPTION</h3>
                <P>
                    We believe God has acted sovereignly to bridge the gap that separates people from Himself. He sent
                    His
                    Son, born of a virgin, attested by miracles and by a sinless life, to bear the full penalty for
                    humanity’s sin. Christ suffered and died in the place of sinners, bringing about true reconciliation
                    between God and mankind. Redemption is solely a work of God’s grace, received through faith in Jesus
                    Christ, and never by works of human merit.</P>
                <h3>RESSURECTION</h3>
                <P>We believe Jesus Christ rose bodily from the dead, conquering sin, death and all the powers of Satan.
                    The
                    resurrection is God’s historical affirmation and vindication of Christ’s unique identity, mission
                    and
                    message. Jesus Christ now resides at the right hand of the Father, and lives to indwell all who
                    recognize their sinfulness, who repent and who turn their lives over to His loving authority. We
                    believe
                    that Jesus Christ will return once again ushering in the completion of God’s Kingdom.</P>
                <h3>THE CHURCH</h3>
                <P>We believe the church is the spiritual body of Jesus Christ and that it encompasses all true
                    believers at
                    all times and places. The function of the church is to carry out the Lord’s expressed will through
                    the
                    power of the Holy Spirit. One of the central purposes of the church is to preach the Gospel (both in
                    word and deed), the Good News that people can find hope and salvation from sin through faith in
                    Jesus
                    Christ. This community of believers is made up of people who are neither perfect nor sinless, but by
                    grace their lives are coming more and more under the control of the Holy Spirit, expressing His
                    love,
                    joy, peace, and other Christ-like qualities.</P>
